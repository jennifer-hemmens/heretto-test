MobileView is organized according to system operator tabs.

Using MobileView, a system operator can monitor and maintain cluster activity tabs associated with active projects. You can view reports that demonstrate how the project is leveraging cluster resources, how the project is progressing towards targets, and whether the system is performing as expected.

Some reports provide a more detailed view of your project's progress, allowing you to view the progression of your project's subordinate tasks towards their targets. This provides more nuanced reporting and manipulation, ensuring that you can manage your project more effectively.
