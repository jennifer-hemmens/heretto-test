When you are generating a data view or analyzing entities, you must use filters to specify your search criteria. When a filter is activated, it is indicated with the icon. However, if a filter is invalid, an error or warning message is displayed.

|Code Type|Value|Description|
|---------|-----|-----------|
|A|12211|Error. There is a problem with the information in the filter. You cannot generate the report or search when there is an error.|
|B|23324|Warning. There is a potential problem with the information in the filter. The report or search might take longer than usual to generate.|

Hover your mouse over the health status icon to see the warning or error message in a tooltip. The following table lists some examples of messages you can receive, and what you can do to fix the issue.
