## How to Use This Content

Thunderbird is a fictional software product that's loosely based on actual software products.

**Note:** Any similarities between the descriptions of Thunderbird and a particular product are purely coincidental.

This content was developed to show how a software company could use DITA content to meet their complex and varied needs.

There are DITA mechanisms built into the content to show how DITA provides value to an organization, such as incredibly efficient management of changes to text like company or product names. Feel free to test this by updating the text in the "Name to use" column in the [Product Name Variables](product-name-variables) topic.

When you change the text in that column, such as the company name, the name will update in all documents that reference the company name.

You can also test creating your own deliverables using the existing content. Simply create a new map and drag topics into the map to build a new deliverable. For more information, click the link to see how to [create a map](https://docs.easydita.com/docs/user-guide/180/create/maps).

Please use this content however you'd like. We think it's a great set of content to show how powerful technical documentation written in DITA really is.
